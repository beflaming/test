Deque

Double-ended Queue.   
sequence containers with dynamic sizes that can be expanded or contracted on both ends. (either its front or its back)

Specific libraries may implement deques in different ways, generally as some form of dynamic array. But in any case, they allow for the individual elements to be accessed directly through random access iterators, with storage handled automatically.
ordered in a strict linear sequence;
relatively fast add/remove element at the beginning or the end of the sequence.

at: access element
front: access first element
back: access last element
push_back: add element at the end
push_front: insert element at beginning
pop_back: delete last element
pop_front: delete first elemnet
emplace_front/emplace_back: construct and insert element
